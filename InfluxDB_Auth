The following are the steps to be followed for influxdb authentication:
1.Create at least one admin user
	create user user with password ‘password’
	grant all privileges to user

	Note: Authentication should be disabled in influxdb.conf file while creating first admin user.

2. Enable authentication in influxdb.conf file under [http] section and uncomment it, if commented.

[http]
   enabled = true
   bind-address = ":8086"
   auth-enabled = true
   log-enabled = true
   write-tracing = false
   pprof-enabled = true
   https-enabled = false
   https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"


3.Restart Influxdb 
1.	Authenticate with HTTP ALI 
2.	Authenticate with CLI
Using command auth <username>:     <password>:
 
 
4. Authenticating telegraf requests to influxdb
Uncomment username and password in telegraf.conf file.
Restart telegraf

# Configuration for influxdb server to send metrics to
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  # The full HTTP or UDP endpoint URL for your InfluxDB instance.
  # Multiple urls can be specified but it is assumed that they are part of the same
  # cluster, this means that only ONE of the urls will be written to each interval.
  # urls = ["udp://127.0.0.1:8089"] # UDP endpoint example
  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8086"] # required
  # The target database for metrics (telegraf will create it if not exists)
  database = "telegraf1" # required
  # Precision of writes, valid values are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  # note: using second precision greatly helps InfluxDB compression
  precision = "s"

  ## Write timeout (for the InfluxDB client), formatted as a string.
  ## If not provided, will default to 5s. 0s means no timeout (not recommended).
  timeout = "5s"
   username = "telegraf"
   password = "metrics" 

5. Authenticating jmeter requests to influxdb
Provide username and password in jmeter parameters section.
